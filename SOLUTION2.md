# Deliverable 2: Extending the front end to support SIP

By:

- William Kaiser (xbk6xm@virginia.edu)
- Varun Varma (kgy6hy@virginia.edu)

## Overview

During this deliverable, the Tiny Imperative Programming (TIP) language had the frontend extended to support the SIP language constructs produced by the SIP grammar changes.

Specifically, the following updates were made:

- ASTNode
- ASTVisitor
- ASTBuilder
- Pretty Printer

Additionally, coverage reports were used to verify that added unit tests cover 100% of new lines added.

## Challenges

Completing this project was embarassingly not parallel. High degrees of coordination were required when writing this project to make sure that the work was completed properly.

## Testing

A markdown file [Deliverable 2](./docs/deliverables/deliverable2.md) was used as a working document to coordinate the delegation of testing between the group members.
